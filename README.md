# ChatBot

*A lab report by Noel Konagai*

## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**

I changed my chatbot to have an attitude while chatting to the user. While the chatbot is self-aware (admits that it is forgetful), responds with an attitude when it asks the user the same thing over and over again.

## Record someone trying out your ChatBot

**Using a phone or other video device, record someone trying out your ChatBot. Upload that video to this repository and link to it here!**
